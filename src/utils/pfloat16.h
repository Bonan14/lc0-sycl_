namespace lczero {
// Compressed 16-bit floating point format for probability values.
// Optimised for representing numbers in the [0,1] range.
//
// Source values are 32-bit floats:
// * bit 31 is sign (zero means positive)
// * bit 30 is sign of exponent (zero means nonpositive)
// * bits 29..23 are value bits of exponent
// * bits 22..0 are significand bits (plus a "virtual" always-on bit: s âˆˆ [1,2))
// The number is then sign * 2^exponent * significand, usually.
// See https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html for details.
//
// In compressed 16-bit value we store bits 27..12:
// * bit 31 is always off as values are always >= 0
// * bit 30 is always off as values are always < 2
// * bits 29..28 are only off for values < 4.6566e-10, assume they are always on
// * bits 11..0 are for higher precision, they are dropped leaving only 11 bits
//     of precision
//
// Out of 65556 possible values, 2047 are outside of [0,1] interval (they are in
// interval (1,2)).

// When converting to compressed format, bit 11 is added to in order to make it
// a rounding rather than truncation.
// If the two assumed-on exponent bits (3<<28) are in fact off, the input is
// rounded up to the smallest value with them on. We accomplish this by
// subtracting the two bits from the input and checking for a negative result
// (the subtraction works despite crossing from exponent to significand). This
// is combined with the round-to-nearest addition (1<<11) into one op.
